My full CV can be found [here](../files/CV.pdf)! *Last updated: September 2025*

For a quicker picture, I've included some highlights of my vitae below:

Education
------
* *In Progress* PhD Candidate in Experimental Particle Physics, Duke University *(Durham, NC)*, (Expected finish ~2028/29)
* B.S. in Physics and Mathematics, Berry College *(Rome, GA)*, 2022

Research
------
Highlights are best viewed on my [research page](about:blank)! For a one sentence pitch: I study single top quark decays in the ATLAS detector, and have previously worked on the strips portion of ATLAS' inner tracker upgrade.
